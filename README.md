# Deep Learning based Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis is contextual mining of text which identifies and extracts subjective information in source material, and helps a business to understand the social sentiment of their brand, product or service while monitoring online conversations. In this assignment, you are to implement a sequence-based text classification model to predict the number of positive and negative reviews based on sentiments.

## Dataset
The dataset used here is from https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

## Below are some techniques covered and demonstrated in the Jupyter Notebook
Data preprocessing - using nltk and regex patterns
CBOW Word2Vec modelling
Character based Word2Vec modelling
LSTM based sequence model
PyTorch
Visualisation using matplotlib
Hyperparameter Optimization

## Main goal:
